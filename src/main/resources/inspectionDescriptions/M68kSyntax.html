Reports wrong use of assembler instruction syntax.

The parser allows more combinations than supported by the target CPU.
This inspection does a strict verification on the allowed addressing modes
and operation size for each assembly mnemonic.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Several different error messages may be the result of this verification,
    giving hints whether the first or the second addressing mode is unsupported,
    or if the operands should be swapped to make it a legal instruction.
