Usually, it is expected that an instruction checking the condition codes or using
the condition codes is preceded by an instruction that actually affects the condition
codes. This inspection checks that this is the case.

For example, the 'movea' and 'adda' instructions (which can be (and are!) often written
as 'move' and 'add') do not affect the condition codes and a conditional branch
will not work as expected.

However, this does not need to be a programming error. Advanced coders sometimes
make use of the fact that instructions do not change condition codes and thus
optimize the order of execution.
