Finds dead writes to registers, i.e. writes that will not have any effect.

Issues a weak warning if the instruction affects only condition codes that are later tested.

Analysis is terminated at the next global label or instruction that reads the register or changes control flow
(or preprocessor statements, like conditional IF statements).
